# Despite the recommendation from Hyprland wiki, most environment vars are set
# through "~/.config/environment.d/*.conf". This way variables can be changed
# and reloaded through "systemctl --user daemon-reload" without restarting
# the compositor.

# FIXME: setting PATH through environment.d doesn't seem to work?
export PATH=${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}

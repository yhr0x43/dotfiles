*** TODO [#B] D-Bus Service Files
#+begin_src
dbus-broker-launch[677]: Service file '/usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.xfce.Thunar.FileManager1.service' is not named after the D-Bus name 'org.freedesktop.FileManager1'.
░░ Subject: Invalid service file
░░ Defined-By: dbus-broker
░░ Support: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bus1-devel
░░
░░ A service file is a ini-type configuration file.
░░
░░ It has one required section
░░ named [D-BUS Service]. The section contains the required key 'Name', which
░░ must be a valid D-Bus name that is unique across all service files. It also
░░ contains at least one of the two optional keys 'SystemdService' and 'Exec',
░░ as well as optionally the key 'User'. Exec must be a valid shell command and
░░ User must be a valid user on the system.
░░
░░ A service file should be named after the D-Bus name it configures. That is
░░ a file containing Name=org.foo.bar1 should be named org.foo.bar1.service.
░░ For backwards compatibility, we only warn when files do not follow this
░░ convention when run as a user bus. The system bus considers this an error
░░ and ignores the service file.
